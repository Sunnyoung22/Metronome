## Features ‚ú®

* **Precision Timing**: Uses the Web Audio API for sample-accurate, stable beats.
* **Wide Tempo Range**: Go from a meditative **30 BPM** to a blistering **250 BPM**, complete with traditional musical term indicators (e.g., *Largo, Adagio, Presto*).
* **Multiple Sound Profiles**: Choose from **Classic**, **Woodblock**, and **Digital** tones to suit your preference.
* **Visual Beat Indicator**: A clear, animated circle provides a visual cue for every beat, with the current beat number displayed inside.
* **Customizable Accent Patterns**: Emphasize any beat in a measure by setting it to **Accent**, **Normal**, or **Mute**. This is perfect for practicing complex rhythms and subdivisions.
* **Advanced Practice Modes**:
    * **Auto Tempo Increase**: Automate your speed drills by having the metronome gradually increase the tempo after a set number of bars.
    * **Mute Measures**: Challenge your internal clock by having the metronome automatically go silent for a specified number of bars, forcing you to keep time on your own.
* **Intuitive Controls**: Adjust tempo with a slider, number input, +/- buttons, or **Tap Tempo**.
* **State Persistence**: Your settings‚Äîincluding tempo, volume, sound, and even complex practice patterns‚Äîare **automatically saved** in your browser. When you return, you can pick up right where you left off.
* **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive design with both **Light and Dark themes** that can be toggled manually or adapt to your system settings.
* **Full Keyboard Control**: Operate every core function using keyboard shortcuts without ever touching your mouse.
